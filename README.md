# Repo Man

This is a daft, wee React app with not a lot of practical application, but I don't know as much as I should about React and other modern bits of the web, like ES6 and RESTful APIs. So I'm learning by doing.

This app, Repo Man, uses the Github API to list a user's repos. Simple as that.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
